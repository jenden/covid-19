# COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Visualization

This project recreates the COVID-19 growth trajectory plots using publicly available data compiled by [Johns Hopkins](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData).

### Environment

Create your python virtual environment of choice. When that environment is active, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data

The Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins maintains daily summary of Coronavirus data around the world in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports). Run the `update_data.py`script to update the data. The command below will download the data from Jan 22 to April 25 and save it in the `data/original` folder.

```bash
python scripts/update_data.py data/original
```

### Visualization

Once the data is downloaded, run the `make_plot.py` script to create an interactive plot of the confirmed cases over time. 

```bash
mkdir figures
python scripts/make_plot.py
```
